# SourceCityToolkit - Blender

The Source City Toolkit is a living repository of collaborative tools and assets that we’re making available for free use under a CC0 license.* As the community grows, the Source City is updated to reflect a snapshot of the virtual city. City modders and teams working on projects in Spectra have regular opportunities to submit them for inclusion in the Source City toolkit. Once Spectra maintainers validate and optimize your submission, it will be added to the next release. If you use our toolkit for a project, Spectra related or otherwise, don’t forget to share your creations with us on social media or our Discord forum!

If you have feedback on the contents & formats included in this toolkit, or are interested in becoming a maintainer, reach out to us via our contact form or in the #toolkit channel on the SpectraCities.com Discord.
